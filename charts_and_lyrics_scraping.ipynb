    "### Scraping the Billboard Year End charts and getting the lyrics for the songs from Genius.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using mainly the \"Hot\" charts for each genre, except Pop which doesn't have a \"Hot\" chart. The Hot charts factor in physical sales, radio airplay and streams and as they are normally the 100 most popular songs of the year should be a good represenation of each genre. The Pop chart only factors in radio play.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please Note:\n",
    "- They charts are normally, but not always, 100 entries long. Sometimes it's intentional like the 2016 and earlier Christian charts and all the Pop charts have only 50 entries. Sometimes it looks like there's errors on Billboard's website like for the 2016 Hot 100 where entry 87 is missing. It just goes 86 then 88 for some reason.\n",
    "- Not using the Latin or International charts as some of the songs not being in English would skew later analysis results.\n",
    "- The Pop chart on Billboard only includes radio play so is different from the other charts. The year end chart also only has 50 songs where as the others, except for the Christian chart, normally have 100.\n",
    "- The lyrics for all songs aren't always found. It varies year by year but for example in 2017 27 out of the 650 songs lyrics weren't found. When lyrics aren't found \"None\" is returned.\n",

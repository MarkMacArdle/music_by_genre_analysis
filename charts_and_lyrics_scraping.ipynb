    "Using mainly the \"Hot\" charts for each genre, except Pop which doesn't have a \"Hot\" chart. The Hot charts factor in physical sales, radio airplay and streams and as they are normally the 100 most popular songs of the year should be a good represenation of each genre. The Pop chart only factors in radio play.\n",

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Ohhh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, go!

[Intro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
(¡D.Y.!) Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh, yeah!)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube)

[Pos-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (whoa, whoa)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (whoa, whoa)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (whoa, whoa)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo
¡Bailalo!

You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me

Wake up with no jammies (Nope)

Take my wallet if you want it now

Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

[Bridge]
We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile mmm
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

[Chorus]
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can

Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Got braids in her hair"

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown

Inhibited, limited

You rained down, like...

I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me

Small world, all her friends know of me

Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain

Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""

And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both

I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player

We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me

Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah…

I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right…
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high
Well maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I'm in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters (facts)
I got a selfie with Oprah (facts), I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frowned since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though
Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it

I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone

Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna

Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit

Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes

One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

Don't matter what you do

So good, that you can't explain it

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

Couch by the kitchen

And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say

I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls
Won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Might be over now, but I feel it still

But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me

But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass

Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)

Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming

Rain was dropping, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu

And you're there to save me

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder

I don’t like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there’s comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they’re for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Just another attempt to make the voices stop

Dark rolls in, and it starts to rain
Staring out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushing candy, crushing pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Texting exes, get my fill
Sweating bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singing the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: ""Really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose

Which way is the graveyard?

Shattered by an email
Your words will fade away
Castle built in the sand
Will only last one day

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me

Flowers in her hair, but it just ain't right
June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, we look good together
We look good together

Drove a little slick car to tend bar
With the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin
Always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends
With his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

Oh, name your price to all this living

I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 2]
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Bridge]
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

[Verse 3]
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I’ve been wondering just what would peace be like
I’ve been staring into headlights

A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, “Unwilling to come undone”

Give you the power to believe again

And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me

You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me

Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on.""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my, my, Oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my, my, Oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain

You call on me...
To solve a crooked rhyme
As I'm closing in
Imposing on your slumber
You call on me...
As bells begin to chime

[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil?
That you're on the square?
That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now?
Right here, right now!

[Verse 2: Papa Emeritus III]
Hiding from the light
Sacrificing nothing
Still, you call on me...
For entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails
Into a sacred coffin
You call on me...
For powers clandestine

[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil?
That you're on the square?
That you're on the level?
That you're ready to stand right here, right now?
Right here, right now!

Are you on the square?

Right here, right now!

Brothers and strangers
The king and the beggar bleed the same
We've all got a sickness
A terminal condition
We medicate it
But the pain won't go away

See the eyes of a million faces
Lookin' for it in a million places
Only one can save us, Jesus

You are the cure
Everybody's searching for it
Everybody's reaching out
Trying to grab a hold of something real
You are the cure
Only you can satisfy us
Fill up the void inside us
Never been a heart you couldn't heal
You are the cure

You are the doctor
Healer and father
To the orphan without a home
We fell into darkness
We were lost till you found us
You're the remedy we're looking for

You are the cure for the broken
The hope for a hopeless world
The meaning the purpose
The peace that will make us whole
You don't have to search no more"

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I’ll always be around
You push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
You can’t say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would’ve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

[Bridge]
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out

[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore

You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl

Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite

Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

Found a bar out by the sand, so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye, like nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air the California dream

To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything so I sang along

Yeah, she's moving through my mind

Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?

But it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
Mighta had a little fun
Lotta wrong got done
But it ain’t my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I’m only guilty of a damn good time
No it ain’t my fault

Blame my raisin' on my name
Blame my name on my raisin'
Blame my lack of knowing better on public education
Blame smoke on the fire
Blame fire on the smoke
Blame the fight on the bouncer that couldn’t take a joke
But it ain’t my fault

I got my hands up
I need an alibi
Find me a witness who can testify
You made a mistake
You got the wrong guy
I’m only guilty of a damn good time

No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault
No it ain’t my fault"

They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 2]
So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

[Chorus 2]
When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen

[Verse 3]
So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen

[Outro]
We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen
So baby say yes to me"

Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I’m just getting old
Used to work but now it don’t

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn
And you don’t know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That’ll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn’t roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

[Verse 2]
I wish I didn’t know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn’t working
But I haven’t lost all hope yet
Yeah it’s hurting but it ain’t dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that

Just something that I can believe in

Where the corn grows, up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot, where she came from

With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world

She's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me

With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

So I pull the shades and I make my place as black as night
I feel miserable, and I'm missing you and me
'Nother Sunday morning all alone underneath these sheets

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Verse 2: Chris Young]
Besides the pain, I don't feel a thing
When my buddies call me up, I just let it ring

[Chorus: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not hungover it's true, but I'm still not over you
All messed up, all strung out
I was sitting at home, breaking down
Not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night

[Outro: Chris Young and Vince Gill]
No I'm not out there getting high, underneath some neon lights
Ain't no whiskey strong enough to make things right
I'm just getting over another sober Saturday night"

You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, ""I'm just another fool and this is just another song""
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know

[Bridge]
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start building up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me

[Chorus 1]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

[Chorus 2]
But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I open my eyes, reach for the phone

Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of ""Night Moves""

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart

When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall

Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
Call me old school, but hey

She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me

Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying

I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll

Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink

Using a fake ID at a college bar
Getting caught with a girl in the backseat of a car
Running out on the field for the senior game wearing number 17
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 2]
Like a George Strait cassette in a Pontiac
Or telling Supercuts, ""Let's leave it long in the back""
Wearing a tux in a high school gym
And she's wearing your class ring
There's a last time for everything

[Chorus]
Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
'Cause there's a last time for everything

[Verse 3]
Throwing the ball with the first dog you ever had
Spending all day on the lake with your grandad
Watching Glenn Frey sing ""Already Gone"" at the Forum in LA
There's a last time for everything

Last call, last chance
Last song, last dance
Sometimes you just don't know when that's gonna be
Hold me baby, give me a kiss
Like tonight is all there is
Cause there's a last time for everything

Kissing goodbye on her porch and driving away
Introducing her as your fiancee
Getting woke up at 5 am to see if Santa came
There's a last time for everything

[Verse 5/Outro]
Biscuits and gravy at your momma's house
(Last time for everything)
Spring break on a fold out couch
(Last time for everything)
Little Jimmy on the Opry stage
(Last time for everything)
Hearing Prince sing ""Purple Rain""
(Last time for everything)

Eight years old a couple cane poles sitting down by the creek
Our lines in the water watching those bobbers seeing that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes
At sixteen it was twelve o three standing at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off, interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes

[Chorus]
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes

[Verse 2]
At eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
And I cried, ""man next time to get in here, I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes

Time rolls by the clock don't stop

With all the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times

We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were …

Wrote I love you in lipstick on the mirror
We were shoutin' out the window, like they could hear us at the pier
Said ""Do you think we’ll live forever?"" As we killed another beer

Never felt anything so reckless, we were all lit up and restless
And comin' alive and we were…

Blaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo
Down FM 109 on my FM Radio

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
You know it's been a while

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style singing

Singing ""Rebel Rebel"" at the top of our lungs
Out of town windows down playing those dashboard drums
Everybody said you'd never make it too far
With some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar

You know my crazy dreams
Were busting at the seams
Just like these old boots and jeans

We're never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going, never going outta style
We're never going outta style

I'll pop my collar do my best James Dean
We'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene
Show me your million dollar Marilyn smile
And I'll show you a love love love

That's never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
Never going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
The trends will come and go
The winds of change will blow
The way we love is never going outta style

We could take it slow
Put it on cruise control
The way we love is never going outta style

Never going outta style
I was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night
We're never going outta style
In my Chevy, parking at the levy
Getting hot and heavy after all this time
Never going outta style
We're never going outta style
Yeah, we're never going outta style"

Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay

[Chorus]
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
'Stead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her (on her)
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime

I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough

Well I've woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
That's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road

[Chorus]
And when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her

On a park bench down on 4th Street
That's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped that ring on her hand
And then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell you know
I became a brand new man... because

When I'm holdin' her

Southern bell statue standing in the screen door
Watching her whole world head for an old Ford

Bowling alley burger, fries and a milkshake
Headed to the same old two dollar matinee

Staring at my boots and the dusty old floorboard
Baby two weeks ain't really all that long

Wrap my arms around her skirt
And I cry for him out the window

How to cast an old Zebco

He said if I just believe that's where I'll go

On the outskirts of Heaven

Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever

That's where I wanna hang my wings

When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it

You deserve it baby, you deserve it all

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
Sit down (hol’ up, lil', hol’ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil’, sit down, lil' bitch)

Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

[Verse 2]
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who in front of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit

Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day

And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frowned since '06

I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me

And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today
I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive
I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today
You don't gotta die
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now lemme tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head

Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness

Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years

My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate

Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimised my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'

[Chorus: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Just love me, just love me, just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Love me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

These niggas prayed on my downfall

Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom boom boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

Pulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart

[Chorus]
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

[Post-Chorus]
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now

[Verse 2]
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart

[Chorus]
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now

Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now

Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight

I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now

You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn’t call her, ""Hoe"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave and you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh my God, oh my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste
Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time

[Chorus]
Ayy you, gal, inna di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom shakalacka, boom shakalacka (boom, boom)

No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts (Boom shakalacka, hahaha)
And I know you love your privacy

But I got you open now so I'm 'bout to show you now, show you now

I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma ""at"" your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one

So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'

No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song

Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring

She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame

That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans

Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time

Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes

I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

All she want to do is smoke that broccoli

Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me

Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' fifty-dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me
Call me Deuce or Dos, anything but broke
Got my aim from the scope, got the game by the throat, damn!

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope

The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am

You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop ""Another One"", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap

What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
""Back to Back""? Me and Drizzy laughed at that

They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings

But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, ""Man, why him?""

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance

Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't"

In the backseat of your Rover

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

From your roommate back in Boulder

I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

Why you, why you say ""Let go"" if you're still holding it?

Yo, I just started my sentence like a capital letter
Got bars for years, I hope you send me a letter
Know she'll never be queen, so now she got a vendetta
I ain't talkin' 'bout David when I say I'ma Guetta
Twenty mil' on my off, season of course
Twenty million when you ain't put out no album or tours
Yes, bitch, I'm me
Pretty N-I-C
You get it? Icy
But my name is spelled N-I-C

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my

Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?

Only get all of me once in your lifetime

Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my

Girl you know I brought that thing right up out the darkness
Made that thing a starfish, right up on my swordfish
I'ma bring sparks and your favorite narcs
Ooooh, you raise the bar, you take it far, you rated R
But keep it tight tight, take this D, go night night
Go so far downtown on you, I lose Wi-Fi
Give me high five
'Cause you know you gon' need a goon to come lick, lick your wounds
Got you lit like tick tick tick, like tick tick tick
Tick tick, Tune

You'll never gonna get it
How could you be a friend of mine?

You cut deep, but you don't see
You don't care, and you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet sweet words were all for show
The fuse is set, the dynamite
It goes boom, boom
Boom, Boom, Boom(8x)

You cut deep, but you don't see
You don't care, and you don't bleed
You blow my mind like dynamite
You go boom, boom, boom

You cut deep, and now I know
Sweet sweet words were all for show

I can hear the sound of silence
Right here in your arms

You won't let go of me

You got me right here with my clothes off now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down?

Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waiting for 'em to attack

And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out

Picking up the pieces of my life and hopin' that I'll put together something right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yah, yah, yah
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Swear the sun shinin' on me in my huddle
No matter the trouble surroundin' us
They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God He's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put my mama in the crib, said, ""Stop stressin'""
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, ""Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you boy, since when the money was low""
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leaky like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'

Singin' like a song through the tall oak trees
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind
Yeah, I was all but lost in the moment
I was young and runnin' wide open
It was just another summer night
Had to be the last thing on my mind

[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through

[Verse 2]
I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered, to You, You
You were there
You heard my prayer in that broke down dusty room
It was the first time I said, ""I'm Yours""
The first time I called You Lord

[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through

[Verse 3]
Yeah, it was late in the summer when the northeast breeze
Sang like a song through the oak trees
Pennsylvania, she kind of caught my soul
Which had me a little more open than closed
Walls I built, opinions I learned
Covered in the ashes of bridges I burned
Blind to the arrow that was headed to my heart
But You hit the mark

[Chorus]
When love broke through
You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' through the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke through
And it all began with You
When love broke through

If grace was a kingdom, I stopped at the gate

Said, “Child, don’t you know that the first will be last and the last get a crown”

I wish I could bring so much more
But if it’s true You use broken things
Then here I am Lord, I'm all Yours

The pages of history they tell me it’s true
That it’s never the perfect; it’s always the ones with the scars that You use
Oh, it’s the rebels and the prodigals; it’s the humble and the weak
All the misfit heroes You chose, tell me there’s hope for sinners like me

Remember that You’re God

Run wild. To risk everything. To hold nothing back. To lay it all on the line: your reputation, your success, your comfort. It's that moment when fear is overcome by faith. Live free. It's not the liberty to do whatever you want whenever and wherever you want, but rather it's living in course with the author of humanity and finding freedom by connecting with the creator who conceived you. Let the light flood into your eyes for the first time. Feeling the blood course through your veins, finding the truest version of yourself by knowing the one who knows you even better than you know yourself. Love strong. Because you were first loved. Because without love we all perish. Because the earth and the stars can and will pass away, but love, love will always remain"

I owe my whole life to
I point to You
I point to You

I'll say I'm found in You
People ask where does my story end
I'll say it starts with You

I just want some acres, I come from a small land
Nah, for real, itty bitty
Used to be down, bad boy, now I'm up like Diddy
Got a new wave, and we surfin' through the city
Christ is walkin' wit' me, shinin' bright, we got it litty
Like ""sheesh!""
Out the dog pound, we done made it off the leash
Makin' sure the people comprehend like ""capiche!""
Young Georgia boy comin' straight up out the East
Grindin' 'cause my family gotta feast

Whatchu doin'? You don't measure up, I met the Ruler
Closet full of Js, boy, you never been a shooter
And I don't need a chain, just to prove you, boy, I'm movin'
When you movin' out yo' mama house, off yo' mama couch?
If we livin' what we talk about, you don't talk a lot
Sound booth, rented Lambo, you can say that
Took my money, built a studio, and took the Range back
H-Town to Atlanta, country bama, MC Hammer
Boy, we too legit to quit, I die, I resurrect, mañana
Put a nail up in your coffin, my hammer awesome
I ain't worried 'bout no pro'lems, the Lord I'll call on
My God!
Everybody eatin' if you part of my squad
And they know I'm workin', boy, I stay on my job
You know God my standard, He the answer
I ain't perfect, I'm just purchased, out here workin' with the hammer like

If creation sings Your praises, so will I

Evolving in pursuit of what You said

If creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I, so will I

If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I

If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!

On a hill You created

Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done

If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I

If we're gonna shout
Let love be the cry
We all bleed the same
So tell me why, tell me why

Tell me, who are we
To judge someone
By the kind of clothes they're wearing
Or the color of their skin?

Are you white? (white)
Aren't we all the same inside? (the same inside)

Only love can drive out all the darkness
What are we fighting for?
We were made to carry one another
We were made for more, said...
Only love can drive out all the darkness
What are we fighting for?
We were made to carry one another
We were made for more!

We're more beautiful when we come together...

How many times can one heart break?
It was never supposed to be this way
Look in the mirror, but you find someone you never thought you'd be
Oh, but I can still recognize
The one I love in your tear stained eyes
I know you might not see him now, so lift your eyes to me

[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home

When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended

[Verse 2]
You see your worst mistake
But I see the price I paid
There's nothing you could ever do, to lose what grace has won

So hold on, it's not the end
No, this is where love's work begins
I'm making all things new
And I will make a miracle of you

[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home

When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended

[Bridge]
I see my child, my beloved
The new creation you're becoming
You see the scars from when you fell
But I see the stories they will tell

You see worthless, I see priceless
You see pain, but I see a purpose
You see unworthy, undeserving
But I see you through eyes of mercy

[Chorus]
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
You're not too far gone
You're one step away from home

When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet, no
When you see wounded, I see mended

Ooh, I see mended
Woah, oh I see mended

I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, ""I'll do it in the mornin'""

They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!

You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list

Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now

Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, ""I ain't average.""
He asked me, ""What does that mean?""
I told him, ""Get the pen and pad, please.""
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes

We ain't talked in like six years

Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'

I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you

I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like

You know the glove is my birthplace

Say nothing for me

Get it together
That's what I say to me

You could do better
Be who you're supposed to be
But that's when you came in
Right when I needed you
Said all of the things that I was believing
Not one of them were true

You lifted my head up
I was keeping my head down
I didn't know love
But I do now

And then you broke apart the lies
You told me I had something beautiful inside
You brought to life the part of me I thought had died
'Cause You stood right there until I saw me

I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, ""How Could You Leave Us"" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing ""How Could You Leave Us"" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a ""Rap God""
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

My greatest joy
Is finding You, it's finding you

Take it all, take it all
Take it all, take it all!

[Chorus: Laura Story & Mac Powell]
Take it all
Every hope, every dream, every plan
Take it all
Every weight, all the shame and brokenness
Jesus, I surrender all
Every victory and loss
Take it all, take it all
Till all I have is open hands

[Outro: Laura Story & Mac Powell]
All I have is open hands
I surrender (I surrender)
Till all I have is open hands ..."

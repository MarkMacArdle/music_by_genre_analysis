# Music By Genre Analysis

When going through a recent phase of country music I felt there were way more lyrics about drinking than normal. 
I want to see if this is just me or if this is a measurable thing. 

I plan to get lists of songs in different genres (pop, rock country, rap etc) by scraping the Billboard Charts website and then scraping the lyrics for those songs

Once the data is gathered I'll do analysis of the subject matter, possibly utilising natural language processings or sentiment analysis.
